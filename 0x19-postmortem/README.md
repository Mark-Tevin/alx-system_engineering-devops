0x19. Postmortem

Issue Summary:
Duration: August 13, 2024, 10:00 a.m.â€“April 14, 2024, 1:00 a.m. (EAT)
Impact: The web application experienced intermittent outages, resulting in a 30% decrease in user activity and a significant increase in latency.
Root Cause: A misconfigured caching layer caused excessive load on the database servers, leading to performance degradation and intermittent outages.
Timeline:
10:00 AM: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating increased latency.
10:15 AM: The engineering team notified us and began investigating.
10:30 AM: Initially assumed database issues due to high latency.
11:00 AM: The database team escalated the incident due to the inability to identify the root cause.
11:30 AM: Misleading investigation paths are explored, including network issues and server misconfigurations.
1:00 PM: The incident escalated to senior engineering management for further assistance.
2:00 PM: The root cause was identified as a misconfigured caching layer.
3:00 PM: Configuration changes are implemented to alleviate the load on database servers.
1:00 AM: Services are fully restored after extensive testing.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was traced to a misconfigured caching layer. The cache was not properly configured to handle high traffic, resulting in frequent cache misses and excessive requests forwarded to the database servers. This led to increased load on the database servers, causing performance degradation and intermittent outages.
To resolve the issue, the engineering team reconfigured the caching layer to optimize cache hit rates and reduce the number of requests forwarded to the database servers. Additionally, caching policies were adjusted to better handle peak traffic loads and prevent similar incidents in the future.

Corrective and preventative measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Implement automated monitoring for cache hit rates and database load.
Conduct regular performance audits to identify and address potential bottlenecks.
Enhance communication and collaboration between teams to expedite incident resolution.

Tasks to address the issue:
Update the cache configuration to optimize performance and reduce reliance on database servers.
Implement failover mechanisms to mitigate the impact of future caching layer failures.
Conduct a thorough post-incident analysis to identify any lingering issues or areas for improvement.
